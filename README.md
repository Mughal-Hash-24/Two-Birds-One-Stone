## üåü About the Game
This wasn‚Äôt a recreation.  
This was **mine**.

After countless recreations of classics, I wanted to **step out of the shadows** of existing designs and build something original from scratch.  
And so **Two Birds One Stone** was born ‚Äî a slingshot precision game with dynamic levels, moving enemies, currents, obstacles, and heart-pounding sound effects.  

You don‚Äôt just shoot; you calculate, adapt, and survive.  

> Because in this game, one stone can change everything.

## üñ§ Why This Game is Special
This wasn‚Äôt just a game.  
It was **my first original idea brought to life** ‚Äî without tutorials, without blueprints, just a blank file and ambition.

This project taught me:
- ‚úÖ How to design **level progression dynamically**
- ‚úÖ **Sprite groups** and complex collision systems
- ‚úÖ Implementing **menus**, **state management**, and **audio feedback loops** for polish

> *What if the tension of a slingshot met the chaos of moving targets?*  
This game was my answer.
